VirtualBulletin

What is VirtualBulletin?
VirtualBulletin is a mobile web app designed to connect people with similar interests. Many social
networking sites support the ability to list individual interests or passions, but don't leverage
that information to forge connections between like-minded people. 

Drawing inspiration from the experience of entering someone's room for the first time,
VirtualBulletin seeks to present such interests in a digestible fashion and make recommendations
for in-person social interaction based on users' shared interests.
